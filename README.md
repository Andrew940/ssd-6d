**Wadim Kehl, Fabian Manhardt, Federico Tombari, Slobodan Ilic and Nassir Navab:
SSD-6D: Making RGB-Based 3D Detection and 6D Pose Estimation Great Again. ICCV 2017.**  [(PDF)]( http://campar.in.tum.de/pub/kehl2017iccv/kehl2017iccv.pdf)


and allows to reproduce parts of our work. Note that due to IP issues we can only 
provide our trained networks and the inference part. This allows to produce the detections and 
the 6D pose pools. **Unfortunately, the code for training as well as 2D/3D refinement cannot be made available.**

In order to use the code, you need to download
* the used datasets (hinterstoisser, tejani) in 
SIXD format (e.g. from http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/sixd/challenge_2017/)
* the trained networks from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kzdrrbuqewk81da/AACkYDoOmQ6nsnjULpQYYDD9a?dl=0

and use the run.py script to do the magic. Invoke 'python3 run.py --help' to see the available commands. 
For the correct thresholds you should look at the supplemental material.
